# CD Collection Manager
A simple sample application that uses Java EE technologies.

## About
The application uses JPA, EJBs and JSF with [BootsFaces](https://www.bootsfaces.net/) and was developed for [WilfFly](http://wildfly.org/).
Although the underlying data model is very simple, it has a repository layer and a service layer, that is used by th page backing beans.

For simplicity the application uses an H2 in-memory database as datasource, but this can easily be changed to any other datasource using the WildFly datasource configuration.

## How to build
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) is used to build the program from source code. 
Just execute the following Maven goal to build and package the application:

~~~bash
mvn clean package
~~~

As mentioned earlier an in-memory H2 database is used as datasource, so if WildFly is used no further configuration is required.
To use another datasource simply configure one called called `CDCollectionManagerDS`.
